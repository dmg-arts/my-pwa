/**
 * The submission proxy client.
 *
 * When a detachment has deployed the Apps Script in tools/proxy, cadets stop
 * writing to Drive and post here instead. The script verifies their Google ID
 * token server-side and writes the files with the owner's credentials, which
 * means cadets need no Drive access at all — and therefore cannot read, alter
 * or delete anyone else's feedback.
 *
 * The proxy is optional. A detachment that has not deployed it keeps the
 * previous behaviour, where every cadet needs Editor on the folder. That is a
 * worse position and the setup guide says so, but it works, and forcing an
 * Apps Script deployment on a detachment mid-term to keep a working app running
 * would be the wrong trade.
 *
 * TWO THINGS THAT LOOK WRONG AND ARE NOT
 *
 * **Content-Type is text/plain on a JSON body.** That makes the POST a CORS
 * "simple request", which skips the preflight. Apps Script cannot answer a
 * preflight OPTIONS, so a correctly-labelled application/json post fails before
 * it ever reaches the script. The body really is JSON; only the header is
 * lying, and it is lying to get around a limitation on Google's side.
 *
 * **Errors come back with HTTP 200.** Apps Script renders a thrown error as an
 * HTML page, which a fetch cannot parse into anything useful. The script always
 * answers 200 with `{ok: false, error}` so the cadet sees the actual reason.
 * A non-200 here therefore means the network or the deployment is broken, not
 * that the submission was refused.
