/**
 * Audit trail.
 *
 * Records who did the things that cannot be undone. It exists mainly for one
 * scenario: an instructor who is the subject of a complaint should not be able
 * to delete that complaint and leave no trace. Response and account deletions,
 * password resets, imports, wipes and the annual rollover all land here.
 *
 * Design notes:
 *
 *   - **One file per entry**, under `audit/<YYYY-MM>/`. Same reasoning as
 *     receipts: an append-to-one-array log is a read-modify-write that two
 *     people can clobber, and a log that loses entries under load is worse than
 *     no log because it looks complete. Monthly folders keep any single listing
 *     small.
 *   - **No delete function is exposed.** Entries can still be removed from
 *     Drive directly by anyone with folder access — this is a client-side app
 *     and cannot pretend otherwise. What it gives you is a record that has to
 *     be *deliberately* destroyed rather than one that never existed.
 *   - **Logging never blocks the action it describes.** A failure to write the
 *     log is reported to the console and swallowed; losing an audit line is bad,
 *     but failing a cadet's submission because the log was unreachable is worse.
