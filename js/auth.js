/**
 * Accounts and sessions.
 *
 * Identity is the person's Google account. This app issues no passwords and
 * stores no credentials — `users/users.json` is a **roster**: verified email,
 * roles, AS level, section. Nothing in it is secret.
 *
 * That is a deliberate reversal of the earlier design, and a better one for a
 * regional detachment. Cadets travel in from several schools, so there is no
 * single institutional domain to key on, but every one of them already has a
 * Google account — it is how the det mails them. The roster of allowed emails
 * therefore does the job a domain restriction would do at a single-school unit.
 *
 * It also deletes the two worst jobs in the old scheme: distributing a
 * generated password to every cadet, and resetting the ones they forget.
 *
 * See js/google-identity.js for what the client-side token check is and is not
 * worth. Short version: Drive sharing is the boundary that holds.
