/**
 * Whose results a person may see in the By-instructor view.
 *
 * `panels.js` decides which *spaces* an account reads. This decides which
 * *subjects* within them, which is a different question and the one the
 * oversight tiers turn on:
 *
 *   - an **instructor** sees their own results;
 *   - **cadre** see the instructors they oversee, and themselves;
 *   - a **commander** sees everyone, cadre included.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS, AND WHAT IT IS NOT
 *
 * The proxy applies this rule server-side to the `people` action, so the app
 * will not serve an instructor a By-instructor view of somebody else. That is a
 * real boundary on this view.
 *
 * It is **not** confidentiality. `allResponses` and `catalog` remain open to
 * instructors (`ACTIONS` in tools/proxy/Code.gs), so an instructor holding the
 * proxy URL can still fetch every response in the shared space and group it
 * themselves. Narrowing those actions would also narrow Responses & analysis,
 * which is a separate decision that has not been taken. Do not describe this
 * anywhere as instructors being unable to see each other's feedback — see
 * docs/STYLE.md §4.
 *
 * On a backend with no proxy there is no server to enforce anything, and this
 * runs in the browser as a lens only.
 *
 * **Mirrored in `tools/proxy/Code.gs` as `peopleTierFor` / `subjectAllowed`.**
 * Apps Script cannot import this file, the same reason `SPACE_ACCESS` is
 * declared in both places. Change one, change the other.
