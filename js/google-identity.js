/**
 * Google identity — "Sign in with Google", shared with the Drive adapter.
 *
 * A detachment already runs on Google accounts: cadets read det mail through
 * Gmail whatever their school address says, and the det's drives are already
 * shared to those accounts. Issuing a second username and password for this app
 * duplicates an identity system everyone already carries, and creates the one
 * job admins actually do all day — resetting passwords.
 *
 * So the app stops storing credentials. `users/users.json` becomes a roster:
 * verified email, roles, AS level. Nothing secret lives in it.
 *
 * WHAT THIS CHECK IS WORTH. The ID token is validated here — issuer, audience,
 * expiry, verified email — but this runs in the browser, and a browser is under
 * the control of whoever is sitting at it. Client-side validation stops
 * mistakes, not attackers. The boundaries that actually hold are:
 *
 *   - **Google Drive sharing.** Reading or writing the det's folder requires an
 *     OAuth token issued to an account that has been granted access. Google
 *     enforces that, not this file.
 *   - **The submission proxy** (still to come), which re-verifies the same token
 *     server-side before it writes anything.
 *
 * Which is a better position than the password scheme it replaces: those hashes
 * sat in the same Drive folder as the data they protected.
