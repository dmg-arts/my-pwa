/**
 * Join links — how a device gets pointed at a detachment's folder.
 *
 * Without this, every device runs the full setup wizard: choose a backend, paste
 * an OAuth Client ID, paste a Drive folder link. That is a reasonable thing to
 * ask of the one administrator who sets the detachment up. It is not a
 * reasonable thing to ask of a hundred cadets on their phones, and the first
 * live install made that obvious — the same values were pasted three times in
 * one evening on three devices.
 *
 * A join link carries the configuration instead:
 *
 *     https://det.example.org/app/#/join?c=<client>&f=<folder>&n=<name>
 *
 * The cadet taps it, approves Drive access once, and lands signed in. Nothing
 * is typed.
 *
 * WHAT A JOIN LINK IS NOT. It is not a credential. The Client ID is designed to
 * be public and ships in the page source of every app that uses one; the folder
 * ID is an address rather than a key, and reaching the folder still needs Google
 * to have granted that account access. Being able to connect grants nothing on
 * its own — the roster decides who may sign in and as what.
 *
 * WHAT A JOIN LINK IS, THOUGH, AND THIS PART MATTERS
 *
 * The `p` parameter names the **submission server**: the address this device
 * will send every answer to, along with the Google ID token proving who sent
 * it. That is not an address in the harmless sense. A link carrying somebody
 * else's `p` points a cadet's device at somebody else's server, which then holds
 * a valid token for that cadet and can replay it against the real one.
 *
 * An earlier version of this comment said a join link was "safe to post
 * anywhere". That was written before `p` existed and it was wrong afterwards.
 * A join link should be treated the way a detachment treats any other
 * instruction it issues: it is fine to send through the channels the det
 * already uses, and it should not be followed from a source nobody recognises.
 *
 * So `p` is parsed strictly here — only an Apps Script deployment, never an
 * arbitrary address — and `views/join.js` refuses to re-point a device that is
 * already configured. Neither stops somebody who follows a crafted link on a
 * fresh device, and nothing in the link can: it is unauthenticated data, and no
 * check the client performs against an attacker's own endpoint can be trusted.
 * What they do is remove the silent cases.
 *
 * This module is deliberately DOM-free so the link format is unit-testable, and
 * so a future QR renderer can consume `buildJoinLink()` without dragging a view
 * along with it.
