/**
 * 9ThirtyOne submission proxy.
 *
 * Runs as a Google Apps Script web app inside the detachment's own Google
 * account. Deployment instructions are in README.md next to this file.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 *
 * Without it, a cadet's browser writes their response straight into the
 * detachment's Drive folder. Google requires Editor permission to write, and
 * Drive has no write-without-read, so every cadet who can submit can also open
 * the folder and read every response in it, alter them, or delete the audit log.
 * The app's anonymity design is real within its own screens and worth nothing
 * against a cadet who opens Drive directly.
 *
 * This script breaks that chain. The folder is shared with cadre only. A cadet's
 * device sends its answers here instead, along with the Google ID token proving
 * who they are. This script verifies that token *server-side*, checks the
 * roster, and writes the files using the owner's credentials. The cadet never
 * touches Drive and never needs access to it.
 *
 * WHAT GUARDS THIS ENDPOINT
 *
 * It is deployed as "anyone can access", because cadets are not members of any
 * Workspace domain. So the URL is public and the token check is the only thing
 * standing there. Everything it enforces:
 *
 *   - The ID token is verified against Google, not merely decoded. A token this
 *     script cannot verify is refused.
 *   - The token's audience must equal this detachment's own client ID, so a
 *     token minted for some other app is refused.
 *   - The email must be on the roster, active, and hold the student role.
 *   - **Paths are constructed here, never accepted from the caller.** The client
 *     sends a request id, which is pattern-checked; it cannot send a path.
 *   - One submission per cadet per form, enforced under a script lock, so two
 *     taps on a slow connection cannot both land.
 *
 * IT SERVES READS TOO, AND HAS TO
 *
 * A cadet with no Drive access cannot read `requests/` or `forms/` either, so a
 * write-only proxy would leave them staring at an empty app. The `bundle` action
 * returns exactly what one cadet's screens need — their assignments, the forms
 * to render them, and which they have already done. No responses, not even
 * their own.
 *
 * IT SERVES CADRE TOO, NOW
 *
 * An earlier version of this comment said cadre still reached Drive directly.
 * They no longer do. Role checks in a browser cannot lock anything when every
 * cadre member holds Drive access to the same folder, so the cadre and commander
 * spaces are only genuinely separate because this script decides who may open
 * which folder. `SPACE_ACCESS` is where that lives, and it is enforced by never
 * opening the folder rather than by filtering what was read out of it.
 *
 * WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO
 *
 * It does not re-validate answers against the form definition. The client does
 * that, and duplicating the form engine here would mean maintaining it twice.
 * What this enforces is *who* may write and *how often* — the parts a client
 * cannot be trusted with.
