 * Every screen, from every role's point of view.

 *     python3 serve.py --port 8123 --no-open &
 *     node tools/docs/capture-perspectives.mjs docs/screens
 *
 * Different from `capture-screenshots.mjs`, which takes the handful of images
 * the guide and the deck embed. This takes the **whole app, six times over** —
 * signed out, then once as each of the five roles — so the access model can be
 * looked at rather than reasoned about.
 *
 * WHY THE REFUSALS ARE CAPTURED TOO
 *
 * A screenshot of the Cadre Panel proves cadre can open it. It says nothing
 * about whether an instructor can, and that is the half worth checking. So each
 * role also visits the screens it should *not* reach, and those shots are kept
 * alongside the rest under `refused/`. If one of them ever shows a panel instead
 * of a sign-in gate, that is a security regression somebody can see at a glance.
 *
 * `admin` is deliberately included in that: it implies no other role, so a
 * database administrator meets the same gate as anyone else at the Instructor
 * Panel. That looks like a bug until you know it is the design.
 *
 * The output folder is gitignored. These are for looking at, not for shipping —
 * a full set is a few dozen images and they go stale the moment a view changes.
